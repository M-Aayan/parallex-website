          Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing game developed by the
          Polish studio CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt. Based on
          Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk tabletop game series, the plot is set in
          the fictional metropolis of Night City, California, within the
          dystopian Cyberpunk universe. The player assumes the role of V (voiced
          by Gavin Drea or Cherami Leigh), a mercenary who gets reluctantly
          imbued with a cybernetic "bio-chip" containing an engram of legendary
          rockstar and terrorist Johnny Silverhand (voiced by Keanu Reeves). As
          Johnny's consciousness begins overwriting V's own, the two must work
          together to separate from each other and save V's life.

        <p>
          Grand Theft Auto VI is an upcoming video game in development by
          Rockstar Games. It is due to be the eighth main Grand Theft Auto game,
          following Grand Theft Auto V (2013), and the sixteenth entry overall.
          Set within an open world—the fictional U.S. state of Leonida, based on
          Florida—and its Miami-inspired Vice City, the story is expected to
          follow the criminal duo of Lucia and her male partner.[a] Following
          years of speculation and anticipation, Rockstar confirmed in February
          2022 that the game was in development. That September, footage from
          unfinished versions was leaked on the internet in what journalists
          described as one of the biggest leaks in the history of the video game
          industry. The game was formally revealed in December 2023 and is
          scheduled to be released in late 2025 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox
          Series X/S

        <p>
          The Last of Us Part I is a 2022 action-adventure game developed by
          Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. A remake
          of the 2013 game The Last of Us, it features revised gameplay,
          including enhanced combat and exploration, and expanded accessibility
          options. Players control Joel, who is tasked with escorting the young
          Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States and defend her against
          cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps
          fungus. The game includes a remake of the 2014 expansion pack The Last
          of Us: Left Behind, which follows Ellie and her best friend Riley.
          Development was led by game director Matthew Gallant and creative
          director Shaun Escayg, who replaced original directors Bruce Straley
          and Neil Druckmann. Part I was rebuilt for the updated hardware,
          requiring new animations, art direction, and character models to align
          with the original development team's vision. The cutscenes and
          narrative beats were analyzed to identify crucial storylines and their
          original direction and purpose. The team built upon the game engine of
          The Last of Us Part II (2020) by expanding the gameplay, technology,
          and accessibility features. Part I features audio descriptions,
          supports 3D audio, and uses the DualSense controller's haptic feedback
          and adaptive triggers.
